4. Original price of a product is 'X' taka, discount/sales price is 'Y' taka. Discount percentage is 'Z' %. Declare variable for the amount of 'X', 'Y' & 'Z' separately & assign values. values can be number or number bounded with string. Now calculate the discount percentage and print the output with following template:
